Deep learning programs, like any other, are subject to bugs caused by design smells. In a world where artificial intelligence is increasingly used, early detection of design smells is essential to improve program performance and reduce bug repair costs. Our paper thus contributes to improving the quality of deep learning programs by proposing an approach to the automatic detection of their design smells based on modeling, and the correlation between these smells. A way to help developers design more effective artificial intelligence programs.
