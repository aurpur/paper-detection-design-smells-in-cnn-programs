\label{sec:results}
In this section, we present the results of our study. First, we present the results relating to the detection of design smells in the programs studied. Then, we present the results relative to the analysis of the results.

\subsection{Design smell detection}
\label{sec:results1}
Here we will present numbers on the detection of design smells in all repositories, such as the distribution of design smells in the dataset (the number of repositories per design smell), or the depth (number of occurrences of a design smell in a repository). This will support the hypothesis that design smells can be detected on CNN programs through a \emph{FAST} model in Pharo. As a result, design smells can be detected using modeling.


\subsection{Detection results analysis}
\label{sec:results2}
Here we present the figures on the analysis of design smell detection results in the programs studied. The aim is to present the ranking of design smells and to present numbers on the possible correlation between them. This will support the hypothesis that some design smells are more prevalent than others in CNN programs (in our study frame of reference) and that some design smells show correlations between them.
