    The use of artificial intelligence has been expanding rapidly in all areas of society over the last ten years. As this expansion is unlikely to slow down, it is important to ensure the quality of these programs. Indeed, like any other program, artificial intelligence programs are subject to bugs caused by poor design. In this paper, we focus on the detection of design smells in artificial intelligence programs linked to object detection (Convolutional Neural Network). We propose a modeling-based approach to automatic smells conception detection. Our paper thus contributes to modeling, detecting and analyzing the distribution and correlations between 8 smells conceptions in 500 programs taken from Github, in order to study the use of these smells in industry and propose to developers the possibility of detecting smells as early as possible.\\
