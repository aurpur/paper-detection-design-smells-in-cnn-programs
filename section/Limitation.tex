\subsubsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
Our study took place in a limited context, which we will describe in this section. When we speak of deep learning programs, we are referring to programs containing a convolutional neural network (CNN). It is therefore important to note that there are other types of deep learning programs that are not covered by our study. In addition, there are several types of libraries that can be used to create deep learning programs. Our study is limited to programs created using the TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch frameworks. And our data comes exclusively from open-source repositories such as Github or StackOverflow (for samples). Finally, our design smell detection system is limited to detecting the 8 design smells described above.\\

\subsubsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:futureWork}
Future work can lead in several directions. Indeed, it is possible to apply our
approach to other types of deep learning programs, other libraries, other design
smells, other programming languages and other types of repositories (non-open-source, for example). Although we have performed a static analysis of deep
learning programs, it is also possible to perform a dynamic analysis by
simulating program execution through modeling. In addition to detection via
modeling, other fields of research are detection via machine learning and
automatic correction of design smells. These are very interesting research
topics that could have a major impact on the quality of future deep-learning
programs.
