\label{sec:discussion}
In this section, we discuss the results of our study and answer our research questions. We also discuss the implications of our results in the context of software research and development.
\todo{To be completed}

\subsection{RQ1:\RQOne}
\label{rq1}

Here we will discuss the results of our first research question. We will discuss
the proposed design smell detection technique and its performance. We will
calculate the accuracy, precision and recall of the proposed technique. The
execution time of the proposed system will also be discussed. We'll talk about
the objective (or motivation) behind the question, and recall the method used and the findings.





\subsection{RQ2:\RQTwo}
\label{rq2}

Here we will discuss the results of our second research question. We'll discuss the distribution and depth of design smells in the dataset. We'll talk about the objective (or motivation) behind the question, and recall the method used and the findings.



\subsection{RQ3:\RQThree}
\label{rq3}

Here we'll discuss the relationship between design smells in deep learning programs. We'll talk about the objective (or motivation) behind the question, and recall the method used and the findings.






\subsection{Implications}
\label{implications}
Here, we will discuss the impact of our study on software research and development. We'll also talk about the impact of our results.
